            <h3>Call Me Taz</h3>
            <p>Hi, I'm Taz, a budding developer with a passion for technology!</p>
            <p>For the past few years I’ve been working in the Hospitality Industry. I’m undertaking the Coder Academy Fast Track Bootcamp course in order to upskill and change careers to become a Software Developer. I previously gained a Cert 3 in Media,
                which I feel gives me a solid foundation for studying code. </p>

            <p>After leaving school I studied Hairdressing and Make-up, gaining a Diploma of Specialist Make-up Services. The fact that Media and Beauty are two very different paths is testament to my diversity. Long term though, I believe I will offer more
                value as a technology specialist, and I’m pretty sure I’ll enjoy it more.</p>

            <h3>2020</h3>
            <p>In 2020 I am undertaking the Coder Academy Fast Track Bootcamp course, in the hopes of securing paid employment as a developer upon completion. I have decided to work towards a career in software in order to give myself more opportunity in
                life, as well as working in an industry that is intellectually stimulating. </p>
            <p>Through self-study, I have found coding to be extremely fun, though also challenging, and I am thoroughly enjoying learning to solve problems and create awesome things, which is helping me believe in my own capabilities, and has cemented my
                belief that I will be a valuable asset in the tech community.</p>
        </div>

        <div *ngIf="panelId==3">
            <h3>Down the Line</h3>
            <p>Down the Line, I would love to use tech to educate people on Wildlife, and pair with Animal Rescues in order to reach more people on how we, as a global community, can help reduce the impact we have on natural ecosystems.</p>
            <p>I have a particular passion for reptiles, as I feel they are incredibly misunderstood. A lot of people don't realise how valuable they are to ecosystems, and the impact that decimating the wild population can have on climate change.</p>
            <p>I feel very privileged to have the opportunity to learn to code, and as a result I want to give back in areas that I am passionate about. Specifically, I would like to use this opportunity to give a voice to those who aren't able to speak
                for themselves (animals).
                <p>In addition to this, I would like to encourage others coming into the tech industry by either mentoring women, or potentially volunteering in a developing country to teach kids how to code.</p>

        <div *ngIf="panelId==4">
            <h3>Creativity</h3>
            <p>I believe that creativity is a vital component in software development. It takes a creative mind to think outside the box and come up with inventive ways of developing apps, or designing solutions. When I look around at some of the people
                I most admire in tech, its their ability to translate technical skill into a viable product that I admire most.</p>
            <p>Now that I’ve committed myself to this journey, I intend to apply my unique creative capabilities to the process of designing, developing, communicating with customers/stakeholders, and delivering software.

                <p>One idea that I have in this space, is to create an app - inspired by duo-lingo - to teach programming languages in an interactive and dynamic way, while using a game-play format to present the information.</p>

                <p>Throughout my life I have continually found the creative process inspirational and fulfilling. I can’t wait to practice using it in the coming years.</p>

            <h3>Process</h3>
            <p>I spent some time in the past 2 years doing some self-study in software development. I decided to start with using the Angular framework along with the inevitable HTML, CSS & JavaScript. This site you’re looking at was build from the ground
                up in Angular 8 as a Single Page application. I know it’s not perfect, for example it doesn’t fit perfectly on all device sizes, and I still need to get the service workers functional to make it a progressive web app. </p>
            <p>I think this app does showcase some of my learnings, for example:</p>
            <div id="list">
                <li>Using Angular to create an app</li>
                <li>Using HTML to build the page components</li>
                <li>Building a menu with special formatting (I used HTML tables)</li>
                <li>Using CSS to style what you see</li>
                <li>Using JavaScript to call function that changes the content of the page</li>
                </ul>
            </div>
        </div>
